# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in PHP.

## Game Description

The Number Guessing Game is a command-line game where the computer randomly selects a number within a certain range, and your goal is to guess the number. After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until you guess the correct number. It's a fun way to practice logic and improve your guessing strategy!

## How to Run

   ```bash
   php --version
   ```
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
